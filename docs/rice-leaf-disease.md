### Rice Leaf Diseases Dataset

This dataset contains images of rice leaves affected by various diseases, including Bacterial Leaf Blight, Brown Spot,
Healthy, Leaf Blast, Leaf Blight, Leaf Scald, Leaf Smut, and Narrow Brown Spot. The dataset is structured into three
modes: TRAIN, VAL (validation), and TEST.
